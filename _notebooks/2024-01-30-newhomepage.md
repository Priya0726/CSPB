    Hi, my name is Arushi Pandey. 
    I am 15 years old and I am currently 
    a sophmore at Del Norte High School in 
    San Diego, California. I am an 
    Asian-American female and 
    want to pursue into the world of 
    innovation and engineering. 
    Here is my personal blog!

    Throughout this trimester, 
    I displayed some concepts I have learned 
    on my blog through the integration of 
    HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
    Additionally, this home page displays a 
    variety of skills including adding the 
    colors, fonts, images, gifs, and even animations.
