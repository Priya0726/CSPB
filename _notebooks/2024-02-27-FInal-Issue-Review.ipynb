    "## Overview\n",
    "46% of Americans experience diagnosable mental health conditions at some point in their life. Mental Health affects a large percent of the population and those who do not have diagnosable issues are not exempt from having to make time to take care of their mental health. This website not only gives a preliminary diagnosis but also provides a platform for users to give updates on their life and mental capacity, vent to AI and get helpful feedback from the comfort of their own homes, but also provides games to help increase attention span, calm mood, and more! \n",

    "# My Feature(s):\n",
    "## Feature #1:\n",
    "This feature is a relaxing game that does not require the users to concentrate much or use a lot of their mental energy. This game is a version of the 2048 game that is in a version of binary numbers which will also help the users learn a new skill. As they keep playing the game multiple time, it can help track how their mental capacity is increasing as they are taking in new information to practice a skill.\n",

    "## Feature #2:\n",
    "This feature is a type of diagnostic quiz that users will take to get instant results and feedback to their answers. It has a total of 10 questions that will help identify the depression levels of the user.\n",
